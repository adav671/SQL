#We are going to grabbing a customer's ID that is either living in New York or Oregon from the sales table and then grabbing the order ID, order date and product's name associated with that customer from the forms table and then ordering that information by order's date in descending order.  

SELECT 
  order_id, order_date, product_name AS product, customer_id 
FROM  
  customer.forms AS forms 
WHERE
  customer_id IN (
     SELECT 
        customer_id
     FROM 
        customer.sales AS sales 
     WHERE 
        location = "New York" OR "Oregon" 
   )
ORDER BY 
  order_date;
